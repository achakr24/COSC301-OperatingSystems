Q1) The cd command places you in the home directory. 
The ls command listed the contents of the directory 'cosc301' in my home directory. The -R option includes contents of subdirectories, the -F option for our case marked directories with a trailing slash, and the -l shows you detailed info 

Q2)
firefox &
fg
^C

Q3)
chmod 600 systems.txt
ls -l systems.txt

Q4)
chmod 500 perms.sh
The dot '.' refers to the current directory.
When something is entered into a shell, it assumes that it is a command. The shell then checks if the first string (i.e., sequence of characters) in that text is a built-in command or the absolute path to an executable.So, if we don't add a './' (which states that our .sh is an executible in the current directory), it assumes it's a built-in and says:
perms.sh: command not found

Q5)
chmod 200 systems.txt
--w------- 1 gragtah students 79 2011-08-31 16:44 systems.txt
echo haiku >> systems.txt 

Q6)
1. grep x systems.txt | wc -l
2. grep -v "os" systems.txt | wc -l
3. ps auxww | grep `whoami`| awk '{print $1, $5, $11}' | sort -k1 -nr
4. ps auxww | awk '{print $1}' | sort -k1| uniq -c| sort -k1 -nr
5. ps lists processes, -e for all, and f for full. grep root searches for 'root' (searching for root user), and less opens up the output for viewing a little at a time. Works faster than other text editors for large amounts of text since less does not have to read the entire input file before starting.
6. pwd | xargs du --max-depth=1 | sort -k1 -nr

Q7) 
5. M systems.txt indicates that the file systems.txt was modified and there are changes to be committed since last commit.Doing hg diff gives us the modifications made in the latest uncommitted revision.
